ctypes-opencv-0.7.0 development release
---------------------------------------

Major change that breaks backward compatibility with 0.5 releases: A large number of functions have been improved in their calling sequences. In the previous releases, these functions had some parameters omitted because I thought they were unnecessary. However, my decisions, while offering convenience to a majority of users, made these functions not so compatible with their OpenCV counterparts. Now, the parameters are re-enabled, allowing the functions to be fully compatible with OpenCV's functions. Thanks David Bolen for this key suggestion. These functions are:
- cvGetRows(), cvGetCols(), cvGetSubRect(), cvGetDiag()
- cvCreateMatND(), cvCreateMatNDHeader(), cvInitMatNDHeader()
- cvCreateSparseMat()
- cvGetMat() and cvGetImage()
- cvReshape()
- cvFillPoly(), cvFillConvexPoly(), and cvPolyLine()
- cvFindCornersSubPix()
- cvGoodFeaturesToTrack()
- cvExtractSURF()
- cvFindContours()
- cvPyrSegmentation()
- cvMakeHistHeaderForArray()
- cvConvexHull2()
- cvGetCol(), cvGetRow(), cvMat()
- cvStartReadSeq()
- cvMakeSeqHeaderForArray()
- cvInitTreeNodeIterator()
- cvInitFont()
- cvInitLineIterator()
- cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK()
- cvFindChessboardCorners() and cvDrawChessboardCorners()

Other improvements:
- Improved algorithm for detecting libraries in POSIX systems like Linux and Mac OS
- Improved algorithm for detecting OpenCV's version
- Added David Bolen's enhanced version of 'cx' namespace. Now you can call 'from open import cx' to import all OpenCV's functionality without 'cv' prefixes.
- Added David Bolen's enhancement in Python 3.0 compatibility
- Added additional prototype default values, by David Bolen
- Added David Bolen's cvLoadCast patch to create full object
- Restored _Structure.from_param(), couldn't find any error with the current demos
- Fixed a bug with __del__() functions, by David Bolen

- Fixed a few more small bugs

ctypes-opencv-0.5.0 development release
---------------------------------------

- Major change that breaks backward compatibility: frequent use of variables as pointers to structures are changed to references to structures instead. This allows code to be more secured, more user-friendly, and run slightly faster.

- Fixed many bugs
- Fixed a major bug in callback functions that may, with high probability, crash the user's program. After this fix, ctypes-opencv is very hard to crash, unless a user deliberately tries to do so.

- Added function cvMixChannels()
- Created a few more useful functions
- Added three more demos: camshiftdemo.py, squares.py, and watershed.py

Notes from former contributors
==============================

This file started life as cvtypes.py with the following header (that I can't read)

Wrapper-Modul cvtypes.py zur Verwendung der OpenCV-Bibliothek beta5
unter Python, wobei der Zugriff ueber ctypes erfolgt.
Autor: Michael Otto
To do: noch fehlende Strukturen wrappen (z. B. CvKalman)
       noch fehlende Makros und Inlinefunktionen wrappen
       ausgiebig testen
Log:   2006/07/25 Dokumentationsstrings hinzugefuegt
       2006/07/10 Fehler in cvGEMM, cvMatMulAdd und cvMatMul beseitigt
       2006/06/28 Modul erzeugt

I hacked it both automatically and by hand to bring it up to date with OpenCV 1.0 and
to use prototype for the functions. I also added from_param methods to allow lists to many
functions that expect a C array.

I checked with Michael and he graciously agreed to let me give it away. This software is
free for any use. If you or your lawyer are stupid enough to believe that Micheal or I have
any liability for it, you should not use it, otherwise be our guest.
