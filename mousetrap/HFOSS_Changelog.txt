Changes:
    - New color IDM in src/ocvfw/idms/color.py
    - Color picker now appears in the main window when the idm is set to color
        > The color picker is defined in main.py and sits in it's own expander
    - The writeFirst method in settings.py writes relevant config variables for the color idm
    - Pretty much no new features should be visible to the user when the forehead idm is selected
    - 

Feature requests:
    - Mouse movement still not smooth
    - CPU usage still far too high
        > Maybe consider bridging writing some of the heavy computation
          in C or C++ instead of python.
    - Some architectural issues with settings should be streamlined to ensure
      as few reads/writes from config files as possible during the application
      lifecycle.
