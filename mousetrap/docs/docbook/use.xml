      <title>Understanding the viewer frame</title>

      <para> The viewer frame is the second frame opened when &appname; starts.</para>

      <para> It is composed by 2 main widgets, a Point Mapper which is a simple cartesian plane showing the relative position of the forehead point from the center (Where it was first detected). The second widget is a Video showing the current captured frame of the webcam, it allows users to know the state of the point in the face. </para>

      <para> There are also 3 other widgets above the previusly explaned, those widgets are:</para>
<para>
	<varlistentry>
            <term>Show Point Mapper</term>
		  <listitem> 
		  <para> Hide or Show the point Mapper</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
</para>

<para>

            <term>Show Capture</term>
		  <listitem> 
		  <para> Hide or Show the capture widget</para>

</para>

<para>
	<varlistentry>
            <term>Flip Image</term>
		  <listitem> 
		  <para>This will flip the captured image horizontaly inverting the X axis.</para>
		  <para>
			In some cases the webcams capture images working as a mirror and this will make mousetrap invert the X axis, so it is possible in those cases to flip the image.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
</para>

<para><emphasis>NOTE:</emphasis> It is hardly not recomended to hide the Point Mapper and the Capture view, this widgets are really useful for users to understand whats happening with mousetrap and how it is working.</para>
