ABOUT MOUSETRAP

MouseTrap is an application that allows a user to control the movement of the cursor through a variety of physical movements. There are a number of image detection modules (IDMs) that allow for different use cases. The currently implemented IDMs are forehead tracking, and color-based object tracking. This document will explain how to use the color-based object tracking IDM.

COLOR IDM

To start MouseTrap, type "mousetrap" into the terminal. When the program starts, it will begin grabbing frames from the default image capture device. One of the IDMs will load automatically. To ensure that you have chosen the color IDM, go to the Preferences menu and then the Algorithms tab. Choose "color" and click apply. Then restart MouseTrap.

Once the color IDM is fully loaded, you should see images from your webcam being displayed in the "Camera Image" window. Below that window is the "Script Mapper" window, which helps you guide the mouse once tracking has started.

Before you start tracking, make sure you have selected a color you wish to track! The algorithm identifies objects by their color patterns, so it is important to choose a color that is unique, or at least dissimilar from the color of your face and the color of the wall behind you. Select a color using the color picker, the window between the camera image and the script mapper. Once you have selected a color, press the save button. MouseTrap will automatically consider a range of values centered around the hue that you chose. For example, if you choose yellow (~30), MouseTrap will try and track colors that fall within the range of 25-30, by default. You can set this range in the configuration menu.

When you are ready to track, position the object you want to track in the square displayed in the camera window. This square can be resized to fit the object by pressing the 'n' and 'm' keys. When the object is in position, press Enter to start tracking.

Now, a green dot will appear in the center of the script mapper window. This window maps the position of the green dot in the small box to the position of the mouse cursor on your screen. You can set mouse sensitivity by changing the size of the small box (a larger box means less sensitive mouse movements) in the config menu.

MouseTrap is meant to be used with MouseTweaks to enable clicking. You can turn this on in the accessibility menu!
