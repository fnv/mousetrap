ABOUT MOUSETRAP

MouseTrap is an application that allows a user to control the movement of the cursor through a variety of physical movements. There are a number of image detection modules (IDMs) that allow for different use cases. The currently implemented IDMs are forehead tracking, and color-based object tracking. This document will explain how to create a new IDM.
